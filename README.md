# Extremaverse
this is the GitHub for Extremaverse, a gaming/pop culture timeline by me (captainnintendo is known as KPyall/KDiogee on other platforms) and The Plaintown Kids, based on Indrema, a defunct video game company that existed from 1999-2001 (this TL's version of Indrema was founded as a PC game publisher/developer in the mid-1980s, went to the console business in 2001, same as OTL, and unlike OTL, still exists to this very day)

this is essentially what Indrema's website might look currently
